Machine.Config -It contains configuration for all .Net applications, like console, winforms, web applications etc.
	Web.Config (global, all sites) -Dedicated to the web sites, located in the same folder that machin.config, It can override some configurations of the machine.config
		Web.Config (Site) - You can modify settings of an specific web site by changing the web.config file located in the location of the project
			web.Config (Application) -you can modify settings of an specific application inside a site
				web.config (folder) - you can create folders an add a web.config file to set settings

from the highest level to lowest, the configuration is overwritten.


You can modify the settings by Web Site Administration Tool (WSAT) to access follow the following

1.- right click in the web site project / <properties> option / web <tab>/ <project url>  and copy the port
2.- open a command prompt and browse to C:\Program Files (x86)\IIS Express   (NOT AS ADMINISTRATOR).
3.- execute iisexpress.exe /path:C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\ASP.NETWebAdminFiles /vpath:/ASP.NETWebAdminFiles /port:THEPORT /clr:4.0 /ntlm
4.- finally open a browser with the url http://localhost:PORT/asp.netwebadminfiles/default.aspx?applicationPhysicalPath=PATHTOYOURPROJECT&applicationUrl=/
5.- to get the path of project just right-click on the project and <open project folder> option

you will find 3 main tabs
security .- dedicated to manage users and set permissions to the web site to users
application .- this settings apply to entire application
provider .- you can specify data base provider to create memberships and roles.

The WSAT helps to create and modify website settings that are not inherited, but if a setting is
inherited and cannot be overridden, the setting will be unavailable.

Also you can modify asp.net configuration by The IIS Manager by using a GUI.
