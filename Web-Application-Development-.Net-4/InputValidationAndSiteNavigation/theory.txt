you can associate many validation controls to a input control
By default, when you use validation controls, you are creating validators in the client-side and in the server-side

Server side
	only if all validations of validation controls are right,
	Page.IsValid is automatically set to true. Therefore you need to validate
	IsValid property before run code in the methods
Client side
	you can disable client-side validation by setting to false validation control's EnableClientScript property. 	
	When a control associated to an validation control loose focus, validation client-side take place.
	You can set Validation control's SetFocusOnError property to true for invalid control get focus automatically.
	You can use focus method to set focus to a control.

CauseValidation property 
	Setting CausesValidation property to false avoids validation take place.
	This is useful when you have Cancel Buttons that does not need validation in postback.

Validation Groups
	Set a GroupName to ValidationGroup property in all the validation controls and a generating postback control, to validate only the group of controls
	When you verify IsValid property only the controls group will be validated.
	You can use verify Page.Validate("GroupName") method to specify which gropu to validate
	Page.GetValidators("GroupName") returns the objects in the group

RequiredFieldValidator Control
	verify that an entry is entered in the control. white spaces does not represent an entry
	InitialValue property is used when you want to make sure that an entry does not be selected.
	For example the <select an option..> value set in a drop down list.
CompareValidator Control
	this control uses ControlToValidate and ControlToCompare
		you can compare values (greather than, equal to..)

		you can compare types of values (if is number, date, etc..)
			set type property to the especific type
			also you can set Operator property to DataTypeCheck
RangeValidator Control	
	verify if the entry is within a range by using MinimumValue and MaximumValue properties
RegularExpressionValidator Control
	set ValidationExpression property to an valid regular expression
	you can use the regular expression Editor box, which has some common regular expression


CustomValidator
	Client side
		1. Write a script with the following firm
			function myFunction(source, arguments)
			arguments.Value contains the value to be validated
			set arguments.IsValid = true if there is no fails.
		2. Set ClientFunctionName property to the name of the function
	Server side
		1. write into the ServerValidate event the code
			protected void myMethod_ServerValidate(object source, ServerValidateEventArgs args)
			args.Value contains the value to be validated
			set args.IsValid = true if there is no fails.
ValidationSummary
	ShowMessageBox      set to true for displaying a pop-up message with the validation errors of all validation errors
    ValidationGroup		Set ValidationGroup to the group name, if you have to display errors from a group

Methods to navigate Pages

	1. Client-side Navigation
		Client-side code request a new page (javascript)
		If you want to send information you need to append query string to the url
		you can create this request by
		1.1 using a HyperLink Control
			<asp:HyperLink ID="myHyperLink"
			  runat="server" NavigateUrl="~/myNewPage.aspx">Go to New Page</asp:HyperLink>
			  which render in a <a> tag.
		1.2  creating a javascript code, in the header of the source page
			<script type="text/javascript">
					function MakeARequest() 
					{
						document.location="myNewPage.aspx";
					}
			</script>

			And in a button make a reference in the onclick attribute
			<input  onclick="MakeARequest()" id="Button1" type="button" value="Goto myNewPage"  />
			
		
	2. Cross-page Posting
	   a page send a postback to a different page
	   to send data from a origin page to a processing page you have to do the following
	   
	   2.1 Into the origin page
			2.1.1 Encapsulate the input controls (i.e. TextBox) which have data that you want to be sent 
			2.1.2 Set the Button PostBack property to the processing page url, you can use another control that generate postback 
	   2.2 Into the Processing page
		    2.2.1 Add to the processing page the <%@ PreviousPage directive and associate the origin page	
				<%@ PreviousPageType VirtualPath="~/OriginPage.aspx" %>
			2.2.2 Get access to the property in the processing page
				if(Page.PreviousPage != null)
					lblName.Text = PreviousPage.MyUserName.Text;
				if you do not want to encapsulate the control you can use
					Server.HtmlEncode(((TextBox)PreviousPage.FindControl("MyUserName")).Text);
					

	3. Client-side Browser redirect
		From server-side code, an instruction to the web browser is given to make a new request to a different url
		so, an extra request is generated.
			Response.Redirect("you new url");

		PreviousPage is NOT populted with Client-side Browser redirect 

	4. Server-side Transfer
		Transfer control to a new webpage since server-side code
			Server.Transfer("a new url", false);

			the second parameter is called PreserveForm, it serves to keep form and query string data.
			PrevousPage is pupulated with server-side Transfer

Using Map Navigation
	1. Site Map, it is a xml file to enter a hierarchy of the site
	you ca use the class in code-behind
		protected void Button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
			{
				Response.Redirect(SiteMap.CurrentNode.ChildNode.Url);
			}
	2. SiteMapDataSource Control. By adding a SiteMapDataSource in the page Site Map
	3. Navigation Control like Menu, TreeView and SiteMapPath
		all you need to set DataSourceID to SiteMapDataSource ID
