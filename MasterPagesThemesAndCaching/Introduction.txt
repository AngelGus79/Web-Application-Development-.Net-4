You can modify the settings by Web Site Administration Tool (WSAT) to access follow the following

1.- right click in the web site project / <properties> option / web <tab>/ <project url>  and copy the port
2.- open a command prompt and browse to C:\Program Files (x86)\IIS Express   (NOT AS ADMINISTRATOR).
3.- execute iisexpress.exe /path:C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\ASP.NETWebAdminFiles /vpath:/ASP.NETWebAdminFiles /port:THEPORT /clr:4.0 /ntlm
4.- finally open a browser with the url http://localhost:PORT/asp.netwebadminfiles/default.aspx?applicationPhysicalPath=PATHTOYOURPROJECT&applicationUrl=/
5.- to get the path of project just right-click ono the project and <open project folder> option

you will fing 3 main tabs
security .- dedicated to manage users and set permissions to the web site to users
application .- this settings apply to entire application

The WSAT helps to create and modify website settings that are not inherited, but if a setting is
inherited and cannot be overridden, the setting will be unavailable.
